      <h3>
        Justice40 Initiative
      </h3>
      <p>
        For the first time in our nation’s history, the Federal government has made it a goal that 40 percent of the overall benefits of certain Federal investments flow to disadvantaged communities that are marginalized, underserved, and overburdened by pollution. The following reflects the historic resources available to communities in Fiscal Year 2022 to implement the Justice40 Initiative. Please visit this page

      </p>
      <p>
        
          The goal of 40 percent of overall benefits refers to all covered programs under the Justice40 Initiative. Information about how these programs will identify and track benefits will be shared in the Phase Two Environmental Justice Scorecard.

        Environmental and Civil Rights Protection
      </h3>
      <p>
        Federal agencies are advancing environmental justice by carrying out their responsibilities under the law to identify and address disproportionate and adverse human health, environmental, climate-related and other cumulative impacts on disadvantaged communities, and to ensure that all communities experience the protection of our nation’s bedrock environmental laws. The following information summarizes some of the work the agency has done from January 2021 to September 2022 in these areas.
      </p>
      <h4>
        National Environmental Policy Act
      </h4>
      <p>
        The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) requires Federal agencies to consider and disclose the environmental, health, and community impacts of a decision or planned action before taking it. Environmental reviews that agencies conduct through NEPA help ensure the public is informed about the Federal government’s potential actions, that communities have an opportunity to fully and fairly participate in the government’s decision-making process, and that Federal agencies consider ways to protect and enhance the quality of the human environment and advance environmental justice in decision-making.

        Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Environmental Justice
      </h4>
      <p>
        
          Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 requires that no person be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subject to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance on account of their race, color or national origin. Title VI requires Federal agencies to ensure that programs or activities receiving Federal funding, including those that affect human health or the environment, do not use discriminatory criteria, methods, or practices. The following includes updates from Appalachian Regional Commission on Title VI that are related to environmental justice.

        Justice40 Initiative
      </h3>
      <p>
        For the first time in our nation’s history, the Federal government has made it a goal that 40 percent of the overall benefits of certain Federal investments flow to disadvantaged communities that are marginalized, underserved, and overburdened by pollution. The following reflects the historic resources available to communities in Fiscal Year 2022 to implement the Justice40 Initiative. Please visit this page

      </p>
      <p>
        
          The goal of 40 percent of overall benefits refers to all covered programs under the Justice40 Initiative. Information about how these programs will identify and track benefits will be shared in the Phase Two Environmental Justice Scorecard.

        Environmental and Civil Rights Protection
      </h3>
      <p>
        Federal agencies are advancing environmental justice by carrying out their responsibilities under the law to identify and address disproportionate and adverse human health, environmental, climate-related and other cumulative impacts on disadvantaged communities, and to ensure that all communities experience the protection of our nation’s bedrock environmental laws. The following information summarizes some of the work the agency has done from January 2021 to September 2022 in these areas.

      <h4>
        National Environmental Policy Act
      </h4>
      <p>
        The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) requires Federal agencies to consider and disclose the environmental, health, and community impacts of a decision or planned action before taking it. Environmental reviews that agencies conduct through NEPA help ensure the public is informed about the Federal government’s potential actions, that communities have an opportunity to fully and fairly participate in the government’s decision-making process, and that Federal agencies consider ways to protect and enhance the quality of the human environment and advance environmental justice in decision-making.

        Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Environmental Justice
      </h4>
      <p>
        
          Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 requires that no person be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subject to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance on account of their race, color or national origin. Title VI requires Federal agencies to ensure that programs or activities receiving Federal funding, including those that affect human health or the environment, do not use discriminatory criteria, methods, or practices. The following includes updates from Appalachian Regional Commission on Title VI that are related to environmental justice.

        Institutionalizing Environmental Justice
      </h3>
      <p>
        Since the start of the Biden-Harris Administration, Federal agencies have been working to better institutionalize environmental justice into their work, including by implementing Executive Order 12898 and Executive Order 14008. The following section provides information on some of the work the agency has done from January 2021 to September 2022 to institutionalize environmental justice.

        Justice40 Initiative
      </h3>
      <p>
        For the first time in our nation’s history, the Federal government has made it a goal that 40 percent of the overall benefits of certain Federal investments flow to disadvantaged communities that are marginalized, underserved, and overburdened by pollution. The following reflects the historic resources available to communities in Fiscal Year 2022 to implement the Justice40 Initiative. Please visit this page

          The goal of 40 percent of overall benefits refers to all covered programs under the Justice40 Initiative. Information about how these programs will identify and track benefits will be shared in the Phase Two Environmental Justice Scorecard.

        Environmental and Civil Rights Protection
      </h3>
      <p>
        Federal agencies are advancing environmental justice by carrying out their responsibilities under the law to identify and address disproportionate and adverse human health, environmental, climate-related and other cumulative impacts on disadvantaged communities, and to ensure that all communities experience the protection of our nation’s bedrock environmental laws. The following information summarizes some of the work the agency has done from January 2021 to September 2022 in these areas.
      </p>
      <h4>
        National Environmental Policy Act
      </h4>
      <p>
        The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) requires Federal agencies to consider and disclose the environmental, health, and community impacts of a decision or planned action before taking it. Environmental reviews that agencies conduct through NEPA help ensure the public is informed about the Federal government’s potential actions, that communities have an opportunity to fully and fairly participate in the government’s decision-making process, and that Federal agencies consider ways to protect and enhance the quality of the human environment and advance environmental justice in decision-making.
      </p>

          ARC contracts with partner agencies to do any required NEPA work.

        Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Environmental Justice
      </h4>
      <p>
        
          Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 requires that no person be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subject to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance on account of their race, color or national origin. Title VI requires Federal agencies to ensure that programs or activities receiving Federal funding, including those that affect human health or the environment, do not use discriminatory criteria, methods, or practices. The following includes updates from Appalachian Regional Commission on Title VI that are related to environmental justice.
