        Federal agencies are advancing environmental justice by carrying out their responsibilities under the law to identify and address disproportionate and adverse human health, environmental, climate-related and other cumulative impacts on disadvantaged communities, and to ensure that all communities experience the protection of our nation’s bedrock environmental laws. The following information summarizes some of the work the agency has done from January 2021 to September 2022 in these areas.
      </p>
      <h3>
        National Environmental Policy Act
      </h3>
      <p>
        The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) requires Federal agencies to consider and disclose the environmental, health, and community impacts of a decision or planned action before taking it. Environmental reviews that agencies conduct through NEPA help ensure the public is informed about the Federal government’s potential actions, that communities have an opportunity to fully and fairly participate in the government’s decision-making process, and that Federal agencies consider ways to protect and enhance the quality of the human environment and advance environmental justice in decision-making.

        Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Environmental Justice
      </h3>
      <p>
        Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 requires that no person be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subject to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance on account of their race, color or national origin. Title VI requires Federal agencies to ensure that programs or activities receiving Federal funding, including those that affect human health or the environment, do not use discriminatory criteria, methods, or practices. The following includes updates from 
        <strong>
          Environmental Protection Agency
        </strong>
         on Title VI that are related to environmental justice.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>
          Most complaints under investigation involve state and local agencies and allege that actions or inactions have disparate impacts, and have subjected people to discrimination on the basis of race, national origin, disability, and/or age. Complaints involve many types of facilities and services, including: petrochemical, asphalt, concrete, recycling, CAFO, and water treatment and management services/facilities.

        Centering Justice in Decision-making
      </h3>
      <p>
